"OK, thanks.  The approach here and in my patch work fine if the user controls everything they way they want.   When auto-detecting everything, this patch is better on non-AVX hardware that happens to have RDTSCP. Otherwise, they effectively work the same.  When compiling on a new build host for old compute nodes, this patch will sometimes require the user to make two active settings to make a functional mdrun. That might mean they go hunting for docs twice, unless they find the new install guide section. At least we don't fail mysteriously any more!  When compiling on an old build host for new compute nodes, both patches will sometimes make an mdrun that could be better in up to two ways. We could add a nag message for the double negation of the new code in gmx_detect_hardware.c ""You, too, could be using RDTSCP!"". AFAIK the proposition that using RDTSCP is good in user space is just educated guesswork, though.  I was slightly concerned about one of the latter cases (build host is old, user knows they have AVX on the compute nodes, so they know to set SIMD and don't know RDTSCP exists / is relevant), but if we add the new nag then this case is solved well enough.  So I'm happy to adopt this solution. Thanks! Shall I abandon my patch, send reviewers here, and one of us work on Erik's feedback and/or the new nag?

"On second sought: actually you don't need this file (endpoint) at all. We have already POST /changes that creates a change and what are you doing here is to delegate to its apply() method, after translating your own Input to ChangeInfo. The only reason to have this class is to get the UiAction for granted (Guice DynamicItem binding and discovery).  But you could solve this in different way: just construct UiAction on you own in ProjectJson and add it to actions map manually. See an example how it's done in InlineEdit series: [1]. Now, on the client side, from your custom UiAction you can invoke the original REST endpoint: POST /changes. The only difference to current solution: you would need to pass project name too, obviously.  This also raises the question do we want to have this button on project info screen at all? We could add it to main page (or may be just add a keyboard shortcut), in wich case we are not in project context any more and the dialog must be extended to provide project name (with suggestion oracle for project, like it already does for branches).  I don't have strong preference for one of these solutions. So, you can let it as is for now and wait for opinion of other reveiwers.

I thought about it earlier, but the reason for limiting the range is that we only use the single precision range in the SIMD parts of Gromacs - since all algorithms in particular need to work if the user has set the precision to single - we only use double to improve precision, not range.  One _could_ of course add double precision range tests, but then the next obvious question is why we allow routines to provide incorrect results for NaN, +-infinity, negative zero, etc? And, of course, not to mention - why we allow more than 1 ulp error :-)  For the error functions I actually experimented a bit with only providing accurate results in a smaller-than-double-precision-range, and this might still be a useful optimization strategy in the future.

"I see your point, there is place for improving my original suggestion. The problem with your current code and new suggestion is: you don't respect visibility during the whole loop.

Example: if this code is merged as is or with your new suggestion, and you (you don't have +2 ACL on gerrit-review, right?) would open a change that belongs to a topic, that is shared by 1 million of changes, then you would iterate through all 1 mil. of changes, just to say visible = false, right?",Negative

"> I think it's cleaner. We do not have to re-implement and maintain different versions start-needed-srv in each script. Just one ""vdsm_init_common.sh --start-needed-srv"" to rule them all.  Here we disagree.  But we repeat our-selves... and not progressing, so we can stop doing that... and progress... as whatever we have now is much better than whatever existed before.  When a user/downstream maintainer opens the service/unit/script whatever he expects to actually understand what happens there and why, and not start to dig within application to find issues and modify downstream specific logic.  At upstart of have the start/stop convention (yeah... you need something for legacy sysv, but simple if is doing the work), for systemd you need nothing as it handles the dependencies, for openrc you need nothing as it handles the dependencies.  So the discussion is entirely around the sysv scripts... I do remember that debian does have dependency management based on the header of scripts[1]  So we left with rhel only to handle...

This check was removed along with the corresponding GenFramebuffers and GenRenderbuffers calls because they are redundant(see CheckFBOResources bellow) and the allocated buffers are leaked.

"Patch Set 4:  Although already merged, I don't think this is the right solution.   Currently the behavior of the permissions system (TCEmain and thus also all other components) is to use ""checkLanguageAccess"" only if the TCA for the table has a ""languageField"".  ""pages"" is not such a table, because there is ""pages_language_overlay"". So the current integrators solution to restrict a user not to be able to edit the ""Original Language"" is to remove the permissions for editing table ""pages"" and only allow ""pages_language_overlay"". See also http://forge.typo3.org/issues/27794  This is not what is being done in the patch, but instead you simply check for checkLanguageAccess.  Similar problem we have in the ""List view"", as the context menu provides more options (i.e. for content elements) than really permitted. Permission check in TCEmain is more ""aggressive"" than in the GUI.  Correct solution for this particular fix would be to check if user has ""edit permissions"" on the ""pages"" table - just like TCEmain also does.  As this is confusing for integrators in general, I would rather propose that someone thinks about a better approach on ""language restriction permissions on pages"" in the first place before fixing the GUI.  I am undecided still if we should revert this merge, but I am currently pretty sure we should not backport that to 4.5.

When this happens, the stdout/stderr handles passed to the adb client process will also be inheritable.  When starting the adb server here, care must be taken to reset them to non-inheritable.  Otherwise, something bad happens: even if the adb command completes, the calling process is stuck while read()-ing from the stdout/stderr descriptors, because they're connected to corresponding handles in the adb server process (even if the latter never uses/writes to them).

If you built with the ebuild unmodified, you'd get an image.bin which would be what you want. As far as I could tell looking at the new function, it's identical to the old one except that you're leaving out the original image.bin.  The difference between image.bin and image.rw.bin is that cros_bundle_firmware is being passed the --force-rw option in one case and not in the other. What that does is it changes the way parts of the image are put together so that vboot doesn't allow the RO only optimization even if the RO firmware claims it supports it.  The RO only optimization is where you run the whole firmware out of RO instead of jumping into an RW copy partway through. If you really don't want to enable that optimization, you can not pass that flag to vboot when running VbInit.  Even if you do want to split things out like this, it would be better to take the existing depthcharge function and to selectively build the RO image based on a use flag.

"When you move a host to maintenance then that calls disconnectStorageServer which should remove this definition so in general this shouldn't affect anything negatively.  The case where this would remain is in case of an error flow where for some reason it wasn't disconnected properly or something.  Even if that happens, it's not that interesting as a few leftover connections shouldn't affect the host negatively (think about FC where the host is always connected). The advantage is that most of the time (since hosts don't move between DCs very often) the host would automatically reconnect whenever it reboots (e.g. due to sanlock fencing) and it would be available to engine almost immediately reducing recovery time.  Imo that is more important. See oVirt Bug 881941 - After a reboot of both engine and vdsm domains take a long time (15 minutes) to recover",Neutral
