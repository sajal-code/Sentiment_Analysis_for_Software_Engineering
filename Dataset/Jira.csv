"Well  since you didn't respond to my request I finally did without and checked out what you did.  First of all looking at CIncludeTransformer I have to say that I don't understand why it is doing its own caching. Caching should be the concern of pipelines and sources. If you want preemptive loading of cached content this would much better be implemented as a Source wrapper. In fact we now have such a class in the scratchpad area.  One unpleasant implication of the current design is that as an unsuspecting user of this class, when you turn on caching in this transformer, the cached contents of any included cocoon:// source that identifies a caching pipeline would be cached twice! Once by the pipeline itself and once by the CIncludeTransformer.  Now concerning your patch. I don't quite understand why you retain the validity of the cached contents. The algorithm the caching pipeline uses to determine the validity of the cached contents is as follows: first it looks at the validity of the cached pipeline contents itself, then if the validity by itself indicates it needs a current validity to check against then the pipeline contructs a pipeline validity by calling the participating components' getValidity() methods. If your component now returns the same validity object that you previously returned then that does not make much sense to me.  Since I really needed this functionality myself and I didn't have enough time to discuss and refactor the CIncludeTransformer I implemented my own very basic IncludeTransformer that does exactly what I need, no more no less. I'll post it here if anyone want to use it.  I also looked at the XIncludeTransformer to see if I could implement caching in that one instead. But it seems that the XIncludeTransformer reads included content from URL objects instead of from Source objects.","Neutral"

"Hi Michael  thank you for your answer. I thought that it would not be so easy to solve this issue. Unfortunately.  I agree with you that the main problem here is that a copy action is missing and I guess AttachStrategy.persist is the right place to add some kind of copy functionality.  I started looking into the source code of the enhanced class from the test. PersistenceCapable declares a public method to copy fields (pcCopyFields(...)). Unfortunately you can't use in AttachStrategy.persist, because the entity to persist has no statemanager at this point (an exception InvalidStateException will be the result).  My suggestion is to modify the class enhancement and remove the StateManager check in pcCopyFields (I don't see the need for this check). Afterwards you can use pcCopyFields in AttachStrategy.persist by adding something like  ... if (manager.getCopyNew()) { int[] fields = new int[meta.getFields().length]; for (int i = 0; i < fields.length; i++) fields[i] = i; newInstance.pcCopyFields(pc, fields); } ...  This solution works for my testcase.  As an alternative you can modify (or add an additional) newInstance to copy the data.  I have no real experience with OpenJPA. Perhaps there is a much better solution. ","Positive"

"{quote} This wasn't a problem with my patch, right?  That was an issue of the mahout script in trunk itself? {quote}  Yes it was a problem with the script in trunk. I believe this was due to the fact that the job files were on the classpath instead of all of the dependency jars. Adding the job files to the classpath does not add the dependency jars they contain to the classpath as well. So, no you didn't add this, but it should be fixed (and is in the patch)  {quote} What is the -core option for?  I've never used it, how does it work? {quote}  when you're running bin/mahout in the context of a build the -core option is used to tell it to use the build classpath instead of the classpath used for a binary release. This just follows the pattern established (by Doug?) in the hadoop and nutch launch scripts.  {quote} Also added a help message for the 'run' argument. {quote}  near line 72 in bin/mahout: (this is different from the --help question I had)  {code} echo ""  seq2sparse            generate sparse vectors from a sequence file"" echo ""  vectordump            dump vectors from a sequence file"" echo ""  run                   run mahout tasks using the MahoutDriver, see: http://cwiki.apache.org/MAHOUT/mahoutdriver.html"" {code}  {quote} So you already added the ability to load via classpath, right? If we merge that way of thinking with what I'm currently working on (having a configurable ""MAHOUT_CONF_DIR"" which is used for all these props files), we could just have the mahout shell script just add MAHOUT_CONF_DIR to the classpath (the way you already have it adding the hardwired core/src/main/resources directory) and then it would work that way. {quote}  Yep, that should do it, as long as MAHOUT_CONF_DIR appears before src/main/resources, we should be good to go. It should be added outside of the section of the script that determines if -core has been specified on the command-line.  ","Neutral"

"Hi Ivan   {quote} + long numberOfEntriesToReplicate = lastEntryId - firstEntryId; should be (lastEntryId - firstEntryId) + 1 {quote} You are right, both side entries has to be considered. Thank a lot for noticing it.  {quote} In general, I think this splitting should be in LedgerFragmentReplicator, rather than BookKeeperAdmin. This way you could avoid the need to expose the update of ledger metadata. It will make control flow a little more complex as you'll have to initiate replication on the next subfragment from the callback of the current, but i think it would encapsulate things a bit better. {quote} Yes, in general, all the split logic should be in LFR. I might pushed that code to BKAdmin because, I don't want to disturb admin key flow much, which will go through LFR. Now anyway, I moved that logic, still not disturbing BKAdmin key flows in anyway.

"Yes  bytes + comparator would work fine for jaql.  Preferably  it would be the same comparators that are already used by the sort code  which work on serialized bytes (but also on WritableComparables  so that might be a problem).  If these comparators are inconsistent  then the sort in map/reduce will not work properly.  I think it is ok to document the transitivity requirement  but I don't see how you can enforce it in any way.  Different key types are fine  as long as the comparator knows how to handle them.  If you can't reuse the same comparator interface  I can always implement my comparisons in another place  but I already have two of them (one in the WritableComparable  and one in the Comparator).

Yes, I've tested it in our env. and works well {quote} Is this required? {code} executor = null; {code} {quote} My intention was to set _executor_ explicitly if the call path is _main -> HbaseFsck -> initialPoolNumThreads -> run -> initialPoolNumThreads_, despite it should be no hurt if I remove this statement.  {quote} What JMS said (down to his +1). When you set exec = 0, it makes me wonder if it would ever be non-null and if so, should it be shutdown before you make a new one? But maybe this is an impossible state. {quote} Tks for stack's suggestion !! this way is more safer if any unexpected call happens. So I changed the code snippet into following style.

"> Have checked in this change which can be reviewed here: http://fisheye6.atlassian.com/changelog/click/?cs=766349  > Would appreciate any feedback. I just have the feeling this entire ControlRegistry is growing over our heads. Taking a look at many older applications with older Click releases, I can't stop thinking that Click was very good for years without it. I also received a few custom components for maintenance and I don't think this change (nor ControlRegistry) is of any needed in them (or maybe simply I'm not getting the entire concept).  Of course, I'm a newbie, but my impression is that most of the advantages you list are for ClickClick. Is it possible that the problem is with the ClickClick  approach(and that should be changed), not with Click?  Many parts of Click are simple to understand and nice, but this one is not. Making it even more complex, is just a guarantee that users like me will understand it even less.  From what I saw, one of the most important parts of Click is backward compatibility. For this however, Click should remain very simple, otherwise it will get big and bloated(and it can't afford ""published"" experiments). Tapestry on the other and can do this since with every new version they throw aboard the entire compatibility, so ""experiments"" if go wrong are not that a problem - and history shows that complex things always go wrong sooner or later (latest one: with T5.2 they'll trow maven away now :) )  My wish is when I look at the Click source code to be able to quickly understand what's up there - cause only so I have a good feeling when I use it  in applications (otherwise I have that ""black box feeling"" - and it's not fun ). I think like this, are most users - those who prefer complex thing have a very huge choice of concurrent frameworks :). ","Positive"

"Vishal Kher to Benjamin  Camille  9:38 AM (54 minutes ago)  Hi Ben,  I was going to open a jira after checking with you guys.  With your solution won't we run in into the problem that Camille pointed out by marking the snapshot for lastZxid - 1? - Peer fails after taking the snapshot. The snapshot has applied lastZxid, which created a child znode. During recovery it will apply lastZxid, which will faill with NodeExists and we will increment the Cversion of the parent (after fix for ZOOKEEPER-1046). So creation of sequential znodes won't be be really sequential. This is probably acceptable, but should be clearly documented. If not, then from this bug, it looks to me that patch ZOOKEEPER-1046 was also not complete. We may need to conditionally update cversion.  I think we need a clear document of how snapshots are supposed to work and what to assume while taking snapshots and while recovering from snapshots. It will be very helpful for to verify the correctness of implementation and for future bug fixes.I will open a jira for this bug shortly and post our discussion as well.

I could add the same snk file to trunk and the 2.9.4 branch when I go add the build scripts to the trunk this weekend, so that all the branches are building strong assemblies.

So I don't think ""check for compactions ever N seconds"" is a great policy.

"[~bikassaha] Thanks for the heads-up Bikas! This JIRA is not concerned with the Tez integration for Pig and is simply the abstraction in Pig to allow for alternate ExecutionEngines in Pig. But will certainly change this on the Tez integration side of stuff.  Thanks a lot [~cheolsoo] for continuing this! I think everything looks good from my end. I can certainly see why we may want to keep this on a different branch until everything is finalized. Certain things may still need more work. For example, OutputStats is not completed abstracted out, as it still has references to POStore which is a MR implementation construct. ScriptState/PPNL/JobStats may still need more abstraction (especially PPNL) and reworking to incorporate a new ExecutionEngine abstraction. I think what we have done here is the minimum foundation for an abstraction though, and it would be appropriate to put into trunk, but these are not my decisions to make.  With regard to public methods that were changed, I don't think most of them are a big deal, besides as Cheolsoo said, the PigServer throwing PigException. I never thought IOException was a good exception to throw, but I think reverting PigServer back to IOException as it is userfacing code is not a big deal. The rest of the method signature changes shouldn't be worrisome because most of them are internal to the project.  However, the change from JobStats to MRJobStats, while necessary (as each ExecutionEngine would have it's own type of JobStats it would present to the end user), could be problematic because it is userfacing code and would probably break people who were previously using JobStats. That I think is the most important thing to keep in mind. The task of making the PPNL and JobStats clearly tied to the ExecutionEngine should be thought through also.","Positive"

In any case  fixing the build is pretty trivial  the changes made to ModificationStatement should just be reverted (and we should just pass the CL in argument to executeWithCondition() to SP.cas()).

Maybe we can make SERIAL mean ""wait for nothing on commit, not even a local one"" (which probably amount to making CL.blockfor() return 0 for SERIAL and adding a 'if' in WriteResponseHandler ctor to signal right away if blockfor is 0). * I don't think CL.ANY will really work as for normal writes since we don't generate hints for commit. Maybe we could (generate hints) ultimately btw, but in the meantime, it might make more sense to refuse it (and thus make the default for CAS be either SERIAL if we do the preceding point or ONE). * We don't call CL.validateForWrite() when calling CAS (and we shouldn't as it complains with SERIAL), but maybe we should add a validateForConditionalWrite that would at least check we have the right replication strategy when using the multi-DC specific CLs.","Neutral"

"I just glanced through in general: this is similar to the hack patch i used exploring LUCENE-4089  though I just used a Map<String String>.  The part i didnt like when exploring was more related to how term index/term dictionary are separated: {quote} divisor: generalize this into something simple like a Map<String,String> of codec ""parameters"" that you set on IWC/IR. split divisor from ""don't load terms index"". define these as constants where they belong. I got unhappy here in the ""splitting"" part because I wanted the divisor part in TermsIndexReaderBase, but that doesnt extend FieldsProducer (where i wanted the ""don't load"" part) and wrap the terms dict, instead its backwards and terms dict wraps the TermsIndexReaderBase... maybe we should fix that too? I think this confusing the way it is but I didnt look at how difficult this would be. {quote}  But I think maybe I was trying to tackle too much at once... still as an ""untyped"" parameter I thought it would be useful to fix the semantics all in one break rather than causing confusion down the road.

I'll keep hacking away at in in my toolbox when customer needs dictate.  Am I missing something in your approach, how would I do this then in the XML DSL using your approach?  I think virtual routing is a known limitation of Camel when you start to deploy large scale systems. Out of curiosity have you seen camel ever been deployed with 1000's of routes (and/or routes files)? I think this would have FD and thread overkill problems.

"Split out some fixes to the SSTII bytes tracker getting out of sync w/ the underlying stream  and did some cleanup to make the streamed/file versions less divergent.  Also adds parallel compaction testing to LazilyCompactedRowTest.  CliTest and DefsTest generate compaction loads (in DefsTest's case, on the Migrations CF -- haven't dug into CliTest as much) that break w/ parallel enabled, although the test doesn't actually fail (argh).  Haven't figured out what's causing that, and haven't come up with a way to reproduce in a ""real"" test yet.  The DefsTest does mix lazy/nonlazy iteration in the merge, which may be relevant.  bq. I'm also no proposing to complicate things.  You're right, poor choice of words on my part.  Latest gives the merge executor a SynchronousQueue.  I think that's a better way to cut worst-case, than the Deserializer, for the reason given previously.  bq. 'if...instanceof' business is a bit error prone/ugly  Agreed. Added getColumnCount + reset to ICountableColumnIterator sub-interface.  bq. say how multithreaded_compaction is different from concurrent_compactors and that multithread_compaction is likely only useful for SSDs in cassandra.yaml  done  bq. The bytesRead ""race"" should also be fixed in CompactionIterable  done  bq. I would have put the code in CompactedRow.close() at the end of the LCR.write() instead of adding a new method, as it avoids forgetting calling close  I did consider that, but it feels weird to me to have write implicitly call close.

"Noah said heâ€™s going to fix this in his build-fauxton branch  but Iâ€™d like to explain this for posterity.  make indeed throws this error, I didnâ€™t suggest it is a grunt.js error, but itâ€™s the way we use Autotools. In particular, in how we use Autotools for packaging. Each file that is supposed to end up in our final apache-couchdb-x.y.z.tar.gz tarball needs to be marked as such in a Makefile.am. For Fauxton that means we maintain a list of Fauxton files in src/Makefila.am specified as `FAUXTON_FILES`:  FAUXTON_FILES = \ fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/assets/less/activetasks.less \ fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/base.js \ fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/resources.js \ â€¦and so on  In that list, there is a line: `fauxton/app/initialize.js`, e.g. where we say that file is supposed to go into the release tarball. That file however does not exist at the time `make dist` is run, so make complains. I assume the solution is that make needs to call grunt at some point to turn fauxton/app/initialize.underscore into fauxton/app/initialize.js and I think that is what Noah is doing in his branch. I just wanted to explain, why this isnâ€™t a make error. ","Neutral"

In EditLogFileInputStream, why do we need to pass isInProgress as a boolean? If it's in-progress, that means we don't know the lastTxId, so it would be INVALID_TXID, right? So we can implement isInProgress() by just comparing lastTxId.  Because in the case of pre-transactional ELFIS, we pass in INVALID_TXID, even though the log is not yet in progress.

"{quote} I don't really know much about NamedSPILoader but I think what you're suggesting. How would we support Factories loading unrelated classes like they can through ResourceLoader now? Assume they're on the classpath and use Class.forName? {quote}  It needs more discussion (and input from Uwe would help!), but it works like Charset.forName(""ASCII"") etc. We use this already for codecs and postingsformats (Codec.forName, Codec.listAllCodecs, ...).  Have a look at lucene/core/src/resources/META-INF/services for the idea. Basically you ""register"" your classes in your jar file this way: additional jar files (e.g. look at lucene/test-framework/src/resources/META-INF) can load more classes.  So this could support some idea like TokenizerFactory.forName(""Whitespace"") or something simple like that. So someone would not need to use org.apache.solr.analysis.xxx namespace to be able to load their analyzer stuff easily, they use whatever package they want and register in their META_INF. And added jar files (other analysis jars), are automatically available this way.  I think Uwe mentioned this idea before, though I think he had Analyzers in mind (e.g. provide language code and get back analyzer or something). Anyway thats for another issue :)  Just something worth consideration if we want to make these modules really pluggable. On the other hand we shouldn't use anything overkill if its not the right fit... ","Positive"

I'm working on a garbage collector for the data store. The GC doesn't care about user rights, or, putting it another way, it must be able to access all workspaces. Ideally I'd like to use a SystemSession, but you can't get one outside RepositoryImpl or o.a.j.c package (i.e., getSystemSession(String) is package private, WorkspaceInfo is protected). I understand that these APIs shouldn't be public, but they're useful from within the core. In my case, for the GC. I'm very interested in using another way to walk every workspace, but this other way should guarantee that the repository won't shutdown during a walk operation.

"Hello   Sure you are right here, I didn't make myself clear enough Im sorry.  As you (and RFC959) say, when we are sending the file we should transform to NVT-ASCII but not when we are receiving the file. In this second case, i think that the expected behaviour is that the text message be written to a file with the default line separator for the platform.  The sender converts the data from an internal character representation to the standard 8-bit NVT-ASCII representation (see the Telnet specification).  The receiver will convert the data from the standard form to his own internal form.   Actually , according to the spec before a RETR ASCII operation is transformed we should be converting the charset to ASCII , for our machine could be using EBCDIC  to store files and clients are supposed to expect that files are encoded in NVT-ASCII.  So I don't know ... Any way, this has little priority for me (until someone using a non-ascii-compatible encoding complains) so we could leave this for the future. Any way I don't like ASCII mode for it breaks  the 'REST' command. My implementation only supports binary mode.     ","Negative"

"Using nutch with solr has been a very demanding request  so it will be very useful when this makes into trunk. I have spend some time reviewing the patch  which I find quite elegant.  Some improvements to the patch would be - make NutchDocument implement VersionedWritable instead of writable, and delegate version checking to superclass - refactor getDetails() methods in HitDetailer to Searcher (it is not likely that a class would implement Searcher but not HitDetailer) - use Searcher, delete HitDetailer and SearchBean - Rename XXXBean classes so that they do not include ""bean"". (I think it is confusing to have bean objects that have non-trivial functionality) - refactor LuceneSearchBean.VERSION to RPCSearchBean - remove unrelated changes from the patch.(the changes in NGramProfile, HTMLLanguageParser,LanguageIdentifier,... correct me if i'm wrong)  As far as i can see, we do not need any metadata for Solr backend, and only need Store,Index and Vector options for lucene backend, so i think we can simplify NutchDocument#metadata. We may implement : {code} class FieldMeta { o.a.l.document.Field.Store store; o.a.l.document.Field.Index index; o.a.l.document.Field.TermVector tv; }  FieldMeta[] IndexingFilter.getFields();  class NutchDocument { ... private ArrayList<Field> fieldMeta; ... }  {code}  Or alternatively we may wish to keep add methods of NutchDocument compatible with o.a.l.document.Document, keeping the metadata up-to-date as we add new fields, using this info at LuceneWriter, but ignoring in SolrWriter. This will be slightly slower but the API will be much more intuitive. ","Neutral"

"1. My feeling is that ""if (file.lastModified() < now + ACCESS_TIME_RESOLUTION)"" is not necessary  since the lastModified value will already be truncated to the system resolution  but I do not think it is harmful.  2. I chose to throw exception only if file.canWrite, because I was trying to minimise the impact of the change. It's not clear to me whether setLastModified might work when !file.canWrite. However, it certainly must work (because of GC) if file.canWrite. I would consider moving the canWrite test outside of the setLastModified call, similar to getRecordIfStored, it just wasn't necessary to fix the immediate problem.  3. Well, not swallowed exactly, but caught and converted to failure return code (-1) e.g. see BLOBInDataStore.getSize. In any case, the javadoc for Property.getLength/getLengths documents -1 as a possible ""failure"" return code, so it had to be tested. I think if Property.getLength/getLengths throws an exception, that is already correctly handled.  Thanks for the quick response.  ","Positive"

"Hi Manjula  I think your approach basically looks good. Please see my comments below.  1) I think this code  +        NetworkServerControl serverControl = null; +        int port = TestConfiguration.getCurrent().getPort(); +        String hostName = TestConfiguration.getCurrent().getHostName(); +        serverControl = new NetworkServerControl(InetAddress +                .getByName(hostName), port);// initialized for the shutdown.  could be replaced by a call to NetworkServerTestSetup.getNetworkServerControl()  2) +        try { +            serverControl.shutdown(); +        } catch (Exception e) { +            fail(""Unexpected exception"" + e.getMessage()); +            e.printStackTrace(); +        }  e.printStackTrace() won't ever be called, since it's placed right after a call to fail(). Anyway, I think it is better just to remove the try/catch/fail and let JUnit handle the exception itself.  3) I can't see that getNewPort() is used, so it's probably best to remove it.  4) It looks like most of the changes in TestConfiguration.java are reformatting/white-space changes.

Also there is no mechanism to check whether a particular proxy definition is updated in the registry or not because this configuration is used only at the startup.  We can add this functionality to load the proxy services only at the startup time from the registry (this doesn't mean they are dynamic), but I don't see any value there.

"bq. Actually  DIH started as a standalone webapp inside AOL. We changed it because we didn't want to duplicate the schema in two places and also because we wanted to have it available by default in Solr installations.  Another web app means you need to procure hardware  plan capacity/failover  create firewall holes etc  Even if it were a standalone app, I would still run it on the same hardware that runs Solr, though I might run it on the secondary servers that aren't normally seeing query load.  Why would you need to have the schema in two places?  My DIH config doesn't mention any field names, because all Solr field names match the MySQL field names.  Even if they didn't, I'm not sure why it would be any different than any other SolrJ client, which doesn't need to have a copy of the schema.  bq. Talking to multiple collections was never a goal for DIH â€“ I'm not sure what value it will bring.  I've got a sharded index; currently production is on version 3.5.0.  Full rebuilds are done with DIH because my SolrJ application can't touch it for indexing speed.  It does fine for keeping the index up to date with once-a-minute updates, but for indexing millions of documents per shard, DIH beats it handily even though it's only single-threaded.  If I could put all the DIH stuff into one central place, it might make it easier to manage.  I do intend to look at the DIH code to see how it manages to run so fast, so I can hopefully improve my own code, but I can never find the time. ","Neutral"

"bq. Hmmm  infoStream is just for debugging... should we really make it volatile?  I'll remove its volatile...  {quote} bq.

So you get both incremental building and immutability. {quote}  Oh yeah.  But then we'd clone the full IWC on every set... this seems like overkill in the name of ""purity"".  {quote} What about earlier compromise mentioned by Shay, Mark, me? Keep setters for 'live' properties on IW. This clearly draws the line, and you don't have to consult Javadocs for each and every setting to know if you can change it live or not. {quote}  I really don't like that this approach would split IW configuration into two places.  Like you look at the javadocs for IWC and think that you cannot change the RAM buffer size.  IWC should be the one place you go to see which settings you can change about the IW.  That some of these settings take effect ""live"" while others do not is really an orthogonal (and I think, secondary, ie handled fine w/ jdocs) aspect/concern. ","Neutral"

Jonathan - are you still in the loop on this one?  What do you think?

"Thanks Dawid.  bq. Yes, this is pretty much the top-n nodes reordering that I did, albeit without any optimization of how many n to take (the hardcoded magic constants should probably be justified somehow? Or replaced by a default in FST somewhere?).  bq. Deciding how many nodes to reorder is I think hard â€“ I failed to provide any sensible fast heuristic for that and I simply do a simulated annealing to find a local optimum.  Yeah the algo is simplistic now... and it does force caller to pick the params (though minInCountDeref=3 and maxDerefNodes=Inf are probably pretty good)... we can and should make it more sophisticated over time.  We have at least one spare bit to still use in the arc flags :)  bq. One thing I was wondering is why you decided to integrate the packer with the fst â€“ wouldn't it be cleaner to separate packing from construction? Granted, this requires a double pass over the fst nodes and more intermediate memory but it wouldn't add any more complexity to the builder which is already, ehm, a bit complex . You can compare this design in Morfologik:  Well... it's tricky.  First, I decided to change node targets to ords so that pack could use an array to (relatively!) efficiently hold node data, eg inCount, newAddress, etc.  That required making the first pass FST ""modal"" (deref'd or not).  If we didn't do this then the packer would have to use even less RAM efficient data structures (eg Map<Int,X>) I think?  Second, the format written by the packer is tightly coupled with the FST reading, ie there are sizable differences when reading packed vs unpacked FST.  But I agree it'd be cleaner if we could move packing out (eg Util.pack), and more strongly decouple packing from FST format...  One thing I'd really like to somehow do is create different classes for FST writing vs reading, and different classes for each format.  We now have write-ord, write-non-ord, read-packed, read-unpacked (and even the two readers have 3 different modes depending on INPUT_TYPE).  ","Positive"

"Some thoughts I had about this:  Overall, I think it's a good idea.  Seems like it's not crazy to add and would have multiple benefits.  Logical striping across the L1 boundary is a simple solution to both proactively handle splits and reduce compaction times.  Thoughts on this feature 1. Fixed configs : in the same way that we got a lot of stability by limiting the regions/server to a fixed number, we might want to similarly limit the number of stripes per region to 10 (or X) instead of ""every Y bytes"".  This will help us understand the benefit we get from striping and it's easy to double the striping and chart the difference. 2. NameNode pressure :  Obviously, a 10x striping factor will cause 10x scaling of the FS.  Can we offset this by increasing the HDFS block size, since addBlock dominates at scale?  Really, unlike Hadoop, you have all of the HFile or none of it.  Missing a portion of the HFile currently invalidates the whole file.  You really need 1 HDFS block == 1 HFile.  However, we could probably just toy with increasing it by the striping factor right now and seeing if that balances things. 3. Open Times : I think this will be an issue, specifically on server start.  Need to be careful here. 4. Major compaction : you can perform a major compaction (remove deletes) as long as you have [i,end) contiguous.  I don't think you'd need to involve L0 files in an MC at all.  Save the complexity.  Furthermore, part of the reason why we created the tiered compaction is to prevent small/new files from participating in MC because of cache thrashing, poor minor compactions, and a handful of other reasons.  So, some thoughts on related pain points we seem to have that tie into this feature: 1. Reduce Cache thrashing : region moves kill us a lot of time because we have a cold cache.  There is a worry that more aggressive compactions mean more thrashing.  I think it will actual even this out better since right now a MC causes a lot of churn.  Just should be thinking about this if perf after the feature isn't what we desire. 2. Unnecessary IOPS : outside of this algorithm, we should just completely get rid of the requirement to compact after a split.  We have the block cache, so given a [start,end) in the file, we can easily tell our mid point for future splits.  There's little reason to aggressively churn in this way after splitting. 3. Poor locality : for grid topology setups, we should eventually make the striping algorithm a little more intelligent about picking our replicas.  If all stripes go to the same secondary & tertiary node, then splits have a very restricted set of servers to chose for datanode locality. ","Positive"

The code I have, as written, does have the pluggable handler notion, since I didn't want to arbitrarily couple the XMLBuffer class implementation (or worse, it's interface) to the scanner. I didn't go so overboard as to allow multiple registered handlers, or anything like that; this seemed simple enough without being a hack.  > I'd also observe that XMLBuffer has to check to use the > infelicitously named ""insureCapacity()"" method to make sure it's > large enough  Yes, this is where I implemented the full-handler invocation. It's more or less as you describe. Once I get everything cleaned up, I'll post the patch here; you'll probably find it to be entirely unsurprising.  I think what I'll end up doing to allow user-configurable buffer size limit will be to add a setter method on Parser and AbstractDOMParser, something like setInputBufferSize().

"{quote} I don't think it makes sense to argue about who the exception messages are for [...] {quote}  I think the opposite, because it has an impact on the library design. Not that CM cannot go on with the current way; but my point is that Luc and you are focusing on top-level users while stressing that CM in a low-level component. To me, that is a blatant contradiction that produces drawbacks which I presented in several usage examples (which you didn't address), while you always reply with a single use case where the user is yourself (i.e. a CM developer). Anyone else who is using a high-level application based on CM will be baffled by the ""detailed exception message"" because, in all but the most trivial case, his actions will have only a remote connection to the exception triggered by CM. I'm pinpointing at a minute detail of the design of CM, explaining that it can come in the way of some direct users of CM. The current long list of errors is in fact imposing your view (of what is important) to future application developers. [As an example, let's say that someone wants to create a GUI (e.g. for the statistician referred to above), he will want to define his own detailed error messages to be displayed in the GUI with a formatting of his choice. The statistician will never see the messages created by CM.] If a CM exception (resulting from a precondition violation) reaches the end-user level, it means there was some unanticipated problem in the call chain. And to correct it, one would need more than just the ""detailed message"": the end-user will pass the stack trace to the application developer, who will correct a possible bug in his code (such as a missing check of a precondition) or pass it on the the CM developers.

"{quote} ...but even if we don't do that, i suppose it's also conceivable that someone might have their own Similarity implementation that is expensive to instantiate (ie: maintains some big in memory data structures?) and might want to be able to declare one instance and then refer to it by name in many different fieldType declarations. {quote}  I don't think this is really a use case we need to support: the purpose of Similarity today is to do term weighting, not to be a huge data-structure holder.  While I know Mike's original patch went this way with LUCENE-2392 (e.g. norms), I'm not sure i like it being in Similarity in the future either.  Otherwise concepts like lazy-loading norms and all this other stuff get pushed onto the sim, which is an awkward place (imagine if you have many fields).  So, I think we shouldn't really design for abuses of the API. If there are other use cases for ""named similarity"" that have to do with term weighting, I'm interested. ","Neutral"

"I apologize for taking so long to get to reviewing this.  This has some good elements but also quite a few problems.  Here are a few suggestions.  1. The bindingGBeans do not need to know the name of the gbean they are getting something to bind into jndi from, they need a reference to it.  Similarly they do not need to bind a naming Reference, they can bind the object itself.  For instance, the connector binding gbean can do something like this:  private final ManagedConnectionFactoryWrapper managedConnectionFactoryWrapper; // this is the reference to the gbean that gives us the connection factory to bind  ...  //now it's time to bind the connection factory  Object connectionFactory = managedConnectionFactoryWrapper.$getResource(); globalContext.bind(jndiName, connectionFactory);  This is also going to affect how the builders set up the binding gbeans: they know the name of the appropriate gbean such as managedConnectionFactoryWrapper, since they just created it, so they need to use that name to set the reference pattern in the binding gbean.  The binding gbean will then get (a proxy to) the ""real"" gbean that it can use as outlined above.  2. I don't see an implementation of a writable thread safe jndi Context, as dain pointed out you would need.  3. The zip file consists almost entirely of irrelevant files and the actual source files do not all appear to be in the geronimo project structure.  This makes it extremely hard to figure out what to look at.  4. Some of the code modifications (such as to ServiceConfigBuilder) appear to be test cases rather than production code.  It will be a lot easier to evaluate your work if you keep test cases and production code clearly separated as is done in typical maven projects.  5. I think you will need to redo the openejb work after dain's reintegration of his container rewrite.  Thanks!  Let us know if you have any questions about this.","Positive"

I don't think there's any point in compliance with legacy if nobody depended on the behavior (they couldn't specify the behavior before either).

"Hi Fuhwei   I was a bit worried by the big override method in your patch, so I have taken a good long look at this, but as its an area of the code I'm not very familiar with I can't necessarily jump in with an expert comment.  My current analysis of this is that EMF forces an assumption in the two lines of XSDEcoreBuilder's createFeature method  XSDTypeDefinition elementTypeDefinition = getEffectiveTypeDefinition(xsdComponent, xsdElementDeclaration); EClassifier eClassifier = getEClassifier(elementTypeDefinition);  that the type of an element is contained in the emf representation generated from the input schema.  So, if we could override getEffectiveTypeDefinition and conditionally return an XSDTypeDefinition from the metadata available within our SDO scope then we would be OK.  For the case where the type referenced in the schema was provided by an earlier XSD to SDO conversion I think we can retrieve this data, and then do whatever's necessary, if anything, to get the EClassifier based on that type definition (I haven't spent the time to dig into that as I thought now was a good time to discuss)  This wouldn't cover the case where a schema writer was assuming some types were available that hadn't been produced from an XSD,  but I don't know that that's currently a realistic use case.  If my analysis is correct we could lobby EMF to make a change so that the above two lines were incorporated into a single protected method call that didn't require the EClassifier lookup to proceed via an XSDTypeDefinition instance. Then our override would be able to return an EClassifier based on the xsdComponent and xsdElementDeclaration directly.  What do you think?  Have I missed a/the point here? ","Neutral"

"Release Candidate 1 of this patch.  This patch contains: + add IP Address to CrawlDatum Version 5 (as byte[4]) + a IpAddress Resolver (map runnable) tool to lookup the IP's multithreaded + add a property to define if the IpAddress Resolver should be started as a part of the crawlDb update tool to update the parseoutput folder (contains CrawlDatum Status Linked) of a segment before updating the crawlDb. + using cached IP during Generation  Please review this patch and give me any improvement suggestion, I think this is a very important issue, since it helps to do _real_ whole web crawls and not end up in a honey pot after some fetch iterations.

"Truth is that  the sheer size of CFStore (over 2K line) annoys me. I think this prove CFStore has too much things in it and we messed up at encapsulation. So I tried to make DataTracker be about dealing with the memtables and sstables as much as possible. And being able to have View not leak from DataTracker sound like a proof that we do have some encapsulation there. I'm not claiming it's perfect  but I really don't think that CFStore is our most beautiful class in there and I do believe that DataTracker improves this a bit.  But there is a good part of subjectivity in all this anyway. And if people really don't like the move of the bits of querying in there, fine, I'd move them back in CFStore and leak the View from DataTracker. I would however be more reluctant to remove DataTracker altogether and put the AtomicReference in CFStore. Because this would move all the CAS related logic in CFStore and seriously there is already too much stuff in CFStore. My humble opinion though. ","Neutral"

"> Do you think attached patch is generic?  Nothing is generic until it's used in more than one place.  The above isn't complete (it needs, e.g., 'read()' and 'seek()' implementations) but it looks like a good start.  But the real question is to you: could you use the above?  Can you present the data and checksums as input streams that support read(byte[], int, int) and seek(long)?  It also assumes a particular checksum implementation, CRC32.  If we wish to allow for others, that aspect could be generalized by adding a codec-like interface for checksummers.  But I think we should probably skip that this iteration. ","Neutral"

"John: first off  i want to apologize for the *extremely* belated patch review ... I know i told you i'd try to look at this months ago  but ... yeah ... life tends to get in the way of patches.  on the whole, things seem pretty good -- although you were still using an interface instead of an abstract class.  Having the main API for a type of plugin be an abstract class is an important mechanism to help future proof ourselves against possible additions we want to make the the plugin API in the future; if it's an interface we can't really change it once it's released (because we might break people Impls); if it's an abstract class, we can always provide a default impl for people.  the biggest concern i have about this patch at the moment is that there are no tests, and no example configs, so it's hard to be sure it's even working at all :)  here's what i see as the current todo list for this issue...  1) there are some legacy SolrIndexSearcher constructors that need to delegate to the SolrCore to get indexReaderFactory ... perhaps we should have a helper method that decides which SolrIndexConfig to use based on the ""name"" ? 2) we need tests showing custom IndexReaderFactory getting used (even if it's just a mock IndexReaderFactory thatsets a boolean to show it's being used) ... this will also serve as a test that config syntax works. 3) need commented out example of using a custom indexReaderFactory in example/solr/conf/solrconfig.xml 4) sanity check this against SOLR-465, make sure we aren't painting ourselves into a corner. 5) we should make IndexReaderFactory use the AbstractPluginLoader stuff and remove the guts of SolrIndexConfig.loadIndexReaderFactory.  It looks like we'll need to add a ""single item"" version of load to the AbstractPluginLoader to make that work well.  #5 is something that can be done after this is committed, but 1-4 are pretty important.  If you can update the patch with some configs/tests i'll think about the legacy SolrIndexSearcher constructors and try to figure out a good solution for them ","Positive"
"Patch looks great!  Thanks Artem.  No more mixing in of fuzzy-ness into AnalyzingSuggester.  It looks like we are doing the utf8 conversion + det twice per lookup, once in convertAutomaton and once in getFullPrefixPaths.  But, I think this is inevitable: the first conversion is on the ""straight"" automaton, for exactFirst match, and the second one is on the lev automaton, for non-exactFirst.  Really we should only do the first convertAutomaton if exactFirst is true ... but this is an optimization so we don't need to fix it now. ","Positive"

"It'd work but it's a halfway hack to the real fix we should do in 0.92.  My points is that I think it is a good idea in general to raise this timeout (while adding configs so you don't necessarily have to wait since smallish clusters could use the max param if they want to speed this up)... we have run into the situation where not all RS came in the 3 second window (which really is too small given heartbeat frequency) so I've already ramped up the config timeout for fb production.  But I'm fine implementing the halfway fix if my argument still doesn't win you over :)","Neutral"
