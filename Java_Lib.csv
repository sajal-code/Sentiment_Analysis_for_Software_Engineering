"So if i changed the 1st comparator to sort by name, not price, the 2nd will changed as well, but not the opposite!",Neutral

Thanks in advance to everyone.,Neutral
You can try use byte [ ] instead of String object.,Neutral

"UPDATE: Actually, it turns out that you CAN supply system properties to the Jarsigner tool, it's just not in the help message.",Neutral
Here is a brief description of it.,Neutral
Using CODE_FRAGMENT.,Neutral
There are many errors in this code.,Negative
Inside eclipse installation folder go to FILE_PATH.,Neutral
I also modified the scroll flags: CODE_FRAGMENT.,Neutral
I `am using library CODE_FRAGMENT for work with CODE_FRAGMENT file's.,Neutral
But when I run this json through CODE_FRAGMENT I see that CODE_FRAGMENT been replaced with CODE_FRAGMENT.,Neutral
and the attributes inside context object will also.,Neutral
For me this worked.,Positive
Also each String object contains reference to char array.,Neutral
I have defined an object CODE_FRAGMENT and in my controller I have.,Neutral
"And in your constructor, If you closeley look.",Neutral
I also tried using this.,Neutral
I needed to write a program which adds binary numbers as if they were decimal.,Neutral
Now we're getting to the good part.,Positive
"I'm not too certain that the CODE_FRAGMENT solution is the best solution, but I think far from the worst, and should be pretty good on its own.",Positive
You could use a kind of strategy.,Neutral
"thus I tried to write my own tool using Ruby, which can be found in here.",Neutral
There are one caveat with the use of callbacks in JNA.,Neutral
Here is the code that does the push.,Neutral
You absolutly need to be compiling FILE_NAME JRE NUMBER!!,Neutral
"actually, it looks smth like this.",Neutral
I am using the appcompat_v7 project as a library project in eclipse.,Neutral
And use Java code like this.,Neutral

"So, the booktime and the appointments in it are getting copied.",Neutral
Use it.,Neutral
You do not need to do anything special.,Neutral
But this gets optimized by the JIT and there is no measurable impact in production.,Positive
One last note: you mentioned that your line ``lacked API_NAME ''.,Neutral
It's a good structure for safe publishing of data among threads.,Positive
"Curiously, you are doing it right for the CODE_FRAGMENT property.",Positive
So you must change the signature of your method to.,Neutral
Hope it helps.,Neutral
"Page contain also other components: grid, textarea and etc..",Neutral
this is FILE_NAME to read your data from BlockingQueue.,Neutral
So I obtained the following project structure.,Neutral
They should be unique!,Neutral
Are they equivalent?,Neutral
"In your FILE_NAME, CODE_FRAGMENT has not been set and therefore is CODE_FRAGMENT.",Neutral
The best I've come across so far ( challenge 2 here ) is.,Neutral
Used wrong column names which does not exist in the table.,Negative
"I haven't used EclipseLink myself, so all I can do is guess, but what surprises me is that FILE_NAME doesn't have a setter for the id property.",Negative

you could use.,Neutral
What's happening?,Neutral
I have to implement gtalk like chat application using UDP FILE_NAME.,Neutral
See the documentation of FileWriter.,Neutral
While working with netbeans I have to make a new file of category CODE_FRAGMENT.,Neutral
you need to have FILE_NAME in your classpath in order to reslove this.,Neutral
This is especially true for long lived callbacks.,Neutral
I will post it here if I find anything new.,Neutral
They both seem to print out the list fine.,Positive
"Now in the onCreate method I have insert in all tab, the FILE_NAME, but I will to create three FILE_NAME for the three tabs.",Neutral
"For some mystic reason, the workflow is not enetering if ( )... Same exact code runs perfectly if I directly paste FILE_NAME files from Eclipse's bin folder.",Negative

I understand the boolean expression here.,Positive
Many thanks.,Neutral

"If after retrying for set amount of repetitions call fails, onFailedAfterRetry ( ) is called.",Neutral
"It does its job, but was built for our use case.",Positive
Problem is pretty API_NAME.,Neutral
I don't have any code to show because I don't know where to start.,Negative
Specifically for bower there looks to be a good maven plugin here.,Positive
CODE_FRAGMENT gets the value 1.,Neutral
Add this dependency to your API_NAME.,Neutral
Why does it treat this as my output directory?,Neutral
And then for FILE_NAME we have.,Neutral
The program is just a hello world Program.,Neutral
And I got the output like this.,Neutral

"I wouldn't use CODE_FRAGMENT, I suggest using CODE_FRAGMENT or CODE_FRAGMENT or CODE_FRAGMENT or ( if you have to ) CODE_FRAGMENT.",Neutral
Does anyone know the thinking behind removing this option?,Neutral

Older versions of JSF used instantiation through JSF and you should be using CODE_FRAGMENT.,Neutral
